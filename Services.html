                    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                    <p>This is a work in progress. We are working hard to get this up and running with the LitRPG Guild App.
                        Rewards will be by leveling up and when completing specific quests. The higher the level, the better the reward. Progress must be tracked on the LitRPG Guild App, through your character sheet, and should be automatic. As you complete quests, read books and add books to the library, you earn exp. When you level up, a notification should appear with your choice of rewards.
                        All rewards listed below are examples. No items are guaranteed until received by users. Items cannot be exchanged, returned, or traded for cash value.</p>
